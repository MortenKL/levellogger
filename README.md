# levellogger
Level logger is a log 'drop in' for go, I use it to get a slightly more detailed output

It's probably the simplest log enhancement you can get.
It gives the posibility of specifying loglevels like DEBUG,INFO, WARN, ERROR, e.t.c. and you can chose different log files per level.

It's a work in progress!, not really meant for the public yet, so expect no help :-)
