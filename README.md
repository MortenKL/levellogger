# levellogger
Level logger is a log 'drop in' for go, I use it to get a slightly more detailed output

Update.. The package is now more or less obsolete because of "log/slog" in the go standard library.

It's probably the simplest log enhancement you can get.
It gives the posibility of specifying loglevels like DEBUG,INFO, WARN, ERROR, e.t.c. and you can chose different log files per level.
